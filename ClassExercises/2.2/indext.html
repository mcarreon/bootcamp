        <p>In an ideal world this website wouldn’t exist, a client would acknowledge the importance of having web copy before
            the design starts. Needless to say it’s very important, content is king and people are beginning to understand
            that. However, back over in reality some project schedules and budgets don’t allow for web copy to be written
            before the design phase,
            <span class="indie">this is sad but true.</span>
            <span class="noto"> We’re here to help, we’ve written examples of web copy for over 40 industries for you to use at concept phase
                of your projects to bring a little life and realism to your designs and help you think about who and what
                you are designing for.</span> We want clients and designers alike to think about their design and how it
            will work with the web copy, we want you think about how numbers, symbols and bullet points will look.</p>
