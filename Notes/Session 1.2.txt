CSS Styling 
    For styling, lean towards using a class specifier
    For very specific unique elements, use ID
        recommended to leave IDs out of style sheets
        ID styling will override class

padding 
    space between element and its outer border 
margin
    element and surrounding 
float
    takes the element out of the flow of the document
