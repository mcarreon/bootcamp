    I think the key that will be most challenging is number 4: Patience Makes Perfect. I tend to float around in terms of hobbies and skills, and I think that this is due to my lack of patience and lack of appreciation of the steps in between the overall goal of mastery. I would like to say that it is due to my father also being very impatient, but that is just an excuse as influencers are just that; they can be overcome.
